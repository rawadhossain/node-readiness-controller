# Monitoring

Node Readiness Controller exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics. This page describes the Prometheus metrics exposed by Node Readiness Controller for monitoring rule evaluation, taint operations, failures, and bootstrap progress.

## Metrics Endpoint

The controller serves metrics on `/metrics` only when metrics are explicitly enabled. Depending on the installation, the endpoint is served either over HTTP or over HTTPS. See [Installation](../user-guide/installation.md) for deployment details.

## Supported Metrics

### `node_readiness_rules_total`

Number of `NodeReadinessRule` objects tracked by the controller.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |

### `node_readiness_rule_nodes`

*Available starting from the v0.6.0 release.*

Number of nodes currently held or released by each `NodeReadinessRule`, collected at scrape time from the controller cache.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `gauge` |
| Labels | `rule`, `state` |
| Recorded when | Computed on each Prometheus scrape from the cached node list |

#### Labels

| Label | Description | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rule` | `NodeReadinessRule` name | Any non-dry-run rule name with a valid selector |
| `state` | Whether matching nodes are still tainted by the rule or have had the taint removed | `held`, `released` |

### `node_readiness_bootstrap_completed_total`

Total number of nodes that have completed bootstrap.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |

| Recorded when | The controller marks bootstrap as completed for a node under a bootstrap-only rule |

#### Labels

| Label | Description | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rule` | `NodeReadinessRule` name | Any rule name |

## Reporter Metrics

The `readiness-condition-reporter` serves its own Prometheus metrics on `/metrics`, on the address configured by `METRICS_BIND_ADDRESS`. See [Reporter Configuration](../reference/reporter-configuration.md) for deployment details.

### `node_readiness_reporter_build_info`

Reporter binary version to track fleet version skew.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | Reporter binary version | Any version string |

### `node_readiness_reporter_check_duration_seconds`

Duration of health probe checks.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `histogram` |
| Labels | none |
| Buckets | `0.005, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10` seconds |
